            <br> From the panic backstage, to the hours of rehearsal, to the stress of auditions, I love theatre… I love every part of it! Theatre is a goal-oriented art that continuously challenges me to improve. In 9th grade, one of my directors ended our class early to show us a video called “Rising Beyond Limits with Open Jar Thinking”. The speaker, Jeff Whiting, describes a phenomenon discovered in fleas and their jumping abilities. The study began by putting fleas in a lidded jar. As they tried to jump out, they would hit their head on the lid. After several days the fleas learned to adjust their vertical and would peak just under the lid. After several more days, the top was removed and gave fleas the chance to jump out and free themselves. But they didn't. They would continue to jump the same height despite there being no barrier. Whiting recognized this as a similarity to many people's experiences with rejection, especially in the theatre community. He decided that this mindset wasn't beneficial for him and changed to "open jar thinking." The mentality of knowing you are capable and deserving of a role, job, or position, even after a rejection. His inspirational words have touched me and, at times, can be the most crucial piece of advice for regaining self-assurance. This open jar thinking has given me clarity and confidence that I don't have to question if what I have done, said, or performed was enough because I know I have satisfied the qualifications and have given my all. 
            As I seek to improve, I find guidance in my directors and peers. Theatre has taught me to see the importance everyone can bring into my own story. I was working on a monologue for an upcoming audition and one of my close friends was able to give me advice on what she thought I should do. Theatre is such a welcoming environment. I feel confident asking questions and learning more perspectives that can help my own. I have taken this into the rest of my life by always trying to create a safe environment for others. This attracts people with all types of backgrounds into my life and I am able to adapt and connect easily to many types of people. Theatre has taught me to care for other people because that is what I've felt from those I have been in a cast, company, and class with.

                    Unfortunately, theatre has become somewhat of a dying art. People have shorter attention spans, ticket prices have skyrocketed. There are many reasons. However, the trials put in its way should not be the death of it. Below, a graph is outlined of popular theaters. Please consider supporting one near you.
